## Disclaimer

This tool is for research demonstration purposes only. It should not be used as the sole basis for clinical diagnosis or educational decisions. The system is designed to showcase the potential of machine learning in educational technology and dyslexia research.

Key limitations:
- Based on simulated data
- Limited assessment scope
- Requires clinical validation
- Not intended for clinical use

For actual dyslexia assessment and intervention, please consult qualified educational and medical professionals.

## üîç Research Goal
To develop a feedback-driven ML model that detects dyslexia and simulates how adaptive interventions can evolve in response to a student's progress over time.

## üìÅ How it Works

1. **ML Model**:
   - Trained on real data from a gamified dyslexia screening dataset.
   - Predicts whether a student likely has dyslexia.

2. **Session Simulation**:
   - For each student, generates 10 learning sessions.
   - Tracks performance (accuracy, response time) per session.

3. **Adaptive Intervention**:
   - Adjusts intervention difficulty dynamically based on performance trends.
   - Logged and visualized for each student.

4. **Visual Output**:
   - Accuracy and intervention level over time.
   - Individual reports for each student.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Flask or Streamlit for backend
- HTML/CSS/JS or Streamlit components for frontend
