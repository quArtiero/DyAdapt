A machine learning-based system for early dyslexia detection and personalized learning support.

## Features

- Early dyslexia detection using ensemble ML models
- Adaptive learning system with personalized interventions
- Performance tracking and analysis
- Multi-page web interface
- Real-time predictions and recommendations

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/quArtiero/DyAdapt.git
cd DyAdapt
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

The application consists of two parts: a backend server and a frontend Streamlit app.

### 1. Start the Backend Server

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
python3 backend/app.py
```
The backend server will start on http://localhost:5001

### 2. Start the Frontend Application

Open another terminal and run:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The Streamlit app will open in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501

## Application Structure

- **Home Page**: Overview and navigation
- **Dyslexia Prediction**: Make predictions for new students
- **Student Analysis**: View detailed analysis of student performance
- **Results**: View model performance and research outcomes

## Usage

1. Navigate through the pages using the sidebar menu
2. Enter student data in the Prediction page
3. View analysis and results in the respective pages
4. Use the download buttons to export data

## Important Notes

- This is a research demonstration tool and should not be used for clinical diagnosis
- Always consult qualified professionals for proper assessment
- The system requires both backend and frontend servers to be running simultaneously

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure both servers are running:
   - Backend on port 5001
   - Frontend on port 8501

2. Check for error messages in the terminal

3. Ensure all required packages are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Disclaimer

This tool is for research demonstration purposes only. It should not be used as the sole basis for clinical diagnosis or educational decisions. The system is designed to showcase the potential of machine learning in educational technology and dyslexia research.

Key limitations:
- Based on simulated data
- Limited assessment scope
- Requires clinical validation
- Not intended for clinical use

For actual dyslexia assessment and intervention, please consult qualified educational and medical professionals.

## üîç Research Goal
To develop a feedback-driven ML model that detects dyslexia and simulates how adaptive interventions can evolve in response to a student's progress over time.

## üìÅ How it Works

1. **ML Model**:
   - Trained on real data from a gamified dyslexia screening dataset.
   - Predicts whether a student likely has dyslexia.

2. **Session Simulation**:
   - For each student, generates 10 learning sessions.
   - Tracks performance (accuracy, response time) per session.

3. **Adaptive Intervention**:
   - Adjusts intervention difficulty dynamically based on performance trends.
   - Logged and visualized for each student.

4. **Visual Output**:
   - Accuracy and intervention level over time.
   - Individual reports for each student.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Flask or Streamlit for backend
- HTML/CSS/JS or Streamlit components for frontend
