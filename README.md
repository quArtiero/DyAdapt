## üîÆ Future Directions

- Integration with educational settings
- Expanded assessment methods
- Clinical data validation
- Enhanced intervention strategies

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This tool is for research demonstration purposes only. It should not be used as the sole basis for clinical diagnosis or educational decisions.

**Key Limitations:**
- Based on simulated data
- Limited assessment scope
- Requires clinical validation
- Not intended for clinical use

For actual dyslexia assessment and intervention, please consult qualified educational and medical professionals.

## üîç Research Goal
To develop a feedback-driven ML model that detects dyslexia and simulates how adaptive interventions can evolve in response to a student's progress over time.

## üìÅ How it Works

1. **ML Model**:
   - Trained on real data from a gamified dyslexia screening dataset.
   - Predicts whether a student likely has dyslexia.

2. **Session Simulation**:
   - For each student, generates 10 learning sessions.
   - Tracks performance (accuracy, response time) per session.

3. **Adaptive Intervention**:
   - Adjusts intervention difficulty dynamically based on performance trends.
   - Logged and visualized for each student.

4. **Visual Output**:
   - Accuracy and intervention level over time.
   - Individual reports for each student.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Flask or Streamlit for backend
- HTML/CSS/JS or Streamlit components for frontend
